			<h1>Idiot Tags</h1>
			<p>I love idiot tags. You know what I’m talking about: the labels, signs, and 
				other message holders that tell you not to do things that you would never 
				do anyway. Common sense makes them redundant. And yet, you know that many 
				of them exist because somebody actually did do it, and the rest of us 
				have to put up with the inane messages. I’m sure lawyers are to blame for 
				a fair share of them. This is one I noticed while waiting on my coworker 
				to get our Hertz rental car at the Hartford airport. When I read it, I 
				burst out laughing, imagining somebody actually trying to drive around 
				with the idiot tag hanging there.</p>
